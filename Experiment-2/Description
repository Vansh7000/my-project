This project is a simple Banking UI created using HTML and CSS. It shows a balance and has two buttons: one for Deposit and one for Withdraw.

 HTML Description:
In the HTML file:

There is a main container called .outer_box that holds everything.

Inside it, there's another box .inner_box where all the actual content is placed.

The balance is shown using an <h1> tag with the value $0.

Below that, there are two buttons:

One button is labeled Deposit.

The other button is labeled Withdraw.

This is the basic structure for a banking interface layout.

ðŸŽ¨ CSS Description:
In the CSS file (exp2.css), styling is done to make the page look clean and centered.

The body is styled to center everything using Flexbox and has a light grey background.

The .outer_box has a soft background color, padding, rounded corners, and a shadow to make it stand out.

The .inner_box is white with padding, rounded edges, and a subtle shadowâ€”it looks like a card.

The heading (<h1>) is large and dark, showing the balance clearly.

The buttons are styled with colors:

The Deposit button is green with white text.

The Withdraw button is red with white text.

Both buttons have padding, margin, and rounded edges to make them look neat and clickable.
