The primary goal is to design and build a responsive and professional admin dashboard using HTML and CSS Grid. Additionally, this project focuses on adding theme-switching functionality (light and dark mode) to demonstrate dynamic UI adaptability without reloading the page. This enhances both the usability and user experience of the interface.

Task Description:
This web-based dashboard is divided into four main sections, arranged using CSS Grid layout:

1. Header
Contains:

Dashboard title (Admin Dashboard)

A theme toggle button labeled dark theme (or toggles to light theme after click)

Purpose:

Provides a unified top navigation bar

Enables user control for theme switching

2. Sidebar
Contains:

A vertical navigation menu with links:

Home

Users

Settings

Purpose:

Acts as the primary navigation panel

Positioned using CSS Grid and visually separated with a border

3. Main Content Area
Contains:

A heading (Welcome Admin!...)

Placeholder content describing this as the main area for charts, reports, or dashboard widgets

Purpose:

Represents the central functional part of the dashboard where dynamic data will be displayed

4. Footer
Contains:

A simple copyright

Text: © 2025 Admin Dashboard. All rights reserved.

Purpose:

Final UI section providing legal or informational closure

Layout Details (CSS Grid):
The entire layout uses a 2-column CSS Grid to structure the sections.

header and footer span both columns (grid-column: 1 / span 2)

nav.sidebar occupies the left column

main content takes the right column beside the sidebar

height: 100vh; ensures the dashboard occupies full screen height

Theme Switching Functionality:
Triggered by: Clicking the button with ID themebutton

Mechanism: JavaScript (can be added) toggles between light and dark mode by dynamically:

Changing background color of body, header, main, footer, and nav

Updating text colors to maintain contrast

Benefit:

Provides a user-friendly toggle between modes

No page reload is needed → seamless interaction

Visual & Functional Benefits:
Responsive layout using CSS Grid

Semantic HTML5 structure: <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>

Clean separation of concerns via external stylesheet

Improved accessibility and user customization via theme switch

Conclusion:
This Admin Dashboard effectively showcases how to combine:

Modern layout design (CSS Grid)

Semantic web structure

Interactive theming (via JavaScript toggle)

It is suitable for:

Real-time data monitoring

Internal admin panels

Role-based access systems in web applications
