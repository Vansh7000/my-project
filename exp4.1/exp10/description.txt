 Description
This Node.js program is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) Employee Management System. It allows users to manage employee records stored in an in-memory array (no database or files). The program uses Nodeâ€™s built-in readline module to interact with the user through the terminal.

ðŸ”¹ Features
Menu Display

Shows options:

Add Employee

List Employees

Remove Employee

Exit

Add Employee

Prompts the user to enter an employeeâ€™s name and ID.

Adds the employee to the array.

List Employees

Displays all employees in the array with numbering, names, and IDs.

If no employees exist, it shows a "No employees found" message.

Remove Employee

Asks the user to enter an Employee ID.

Searches for that ID and removes the corresponding employee from the list.

If the ID is not found, it shows "Employee not found."

Exit

Ends the application gracefully with a goodbye message.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works
The application starts by displaying a menu (showMenu() function).

Based on user input, it calls the respective function:

addEmployee() â†’ add new employee

listEmployees() â†’ view all employees

removeEmployee() â†’ delete employee by ID

All employee data is stored in a simple JavaScript array (employees).

Changes only persist during the session (since no external storage/database is used).
