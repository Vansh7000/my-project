This is a simple Express.js server that provides a RESTful API to manage a collection of playing cards. The server stores cards in an in-memory array, so all data will be lost when the server restarts. The API allows users to list, add, retrieve, and delete cards.

Key Features:
List all cards (GET /cards):
Returns an array of all cards in the collection. Each card has an id, suit, and value.

Add a new card (POST /cards):
Accepts JSON data containing suit and value.

Example request body:

json
Copy code
{ "suit": "Clubs", "value": "Q" }
Adds a new card to the collection with a unique id and returns the created card.

Returns 400 Bad Request if suit or value is missing.

Get a specific card by ID (GET /cards/:id):
Returns the card that matches the specified id.

Returns 404 Not Found if no card exists with the given ID.

Delete a card by ID (DELETE /cards/:id):
Removes the card with the specified id from the collection.

Returns the deleted card along with a confirmation message.

Returns 404 Not Found if no card exists with the given ID.

Middleware:
body-parser is used to parse incoming JSON requests.

Server:
Runs on port 3000.

Logs a message to the console when the server starts:

arduino
Copy code
Server is running at http://localhost:3000
Notes:
This implementation is in-memory, meaning the data does not persist across server restarts.

Ideal for learning, testing, or prototyping a simple REST API.
